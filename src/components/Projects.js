      description: `
Built a full-stack web app to help users match their resumes with job listings.
Created a Flask-based backend for scraping job listings from various websites, storing them in a database, and matching them to user resumes using machine learning.
The app allows users to upload resumes, which are then analyzed and compared to job listings to find the best match based on skills, experience, and job requirements.
Built an efficient system for scraping and storing job data, ensuring that the app can handle large datasets.
Integrated a front-end interface with React for a seamless user experience, enabling users to easily upload their resumes and view the best matching jobs.
